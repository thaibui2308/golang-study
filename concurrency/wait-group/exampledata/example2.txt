You should see Hello World displayed in your terminal. 
The go run command takes the subsequent files (separated by spaces), 
compiles them into an executable saved in a temporary directory and then runs the program. 
If you didn't see Hello World displayed you may have made a mistake when typing in the program. 
The Go compiler will give you hints about where the mistake lies. 
Like most compilers, the Go compiler is extremely pedantic and has no tolerance for mistakes.
